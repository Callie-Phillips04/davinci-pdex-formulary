  <h1 id="drug-formulary">US Drug Formulary</h1>
  <p>This project defines a FHIR interface to a health insurer's drug formulary information for patients/consumers. 
    A drug formulary is a list of brand-name and generic prescription drugs a health insurer 
    agrees to pay for, at least partially, as part of health insurance coverage.
    Drug formularies are developed based on the efficacy, safety and cost of drugs. 
   The primary <a href="#use-cases">use cases</a> for this FHIR interface enable consumers/patients to 
   understand the costs and alternatives for drugs that have been prescribed, and to compare their drug
  costs across different insurance plans.</p>
  
  <h2 id="formulary-readme">Contents of This Implementation Guide</h2>
  <p>This implementation guide (IG) consists of 2 FHIR profiles, along with associated extensions, value sets.</p>

  <ul>
      <li><b><a href="StructureDefinition-usdf-CoveragePlan.html">CoveragePlan</a></b>: The CoveragePlan profile of the FHIR R4 <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/list.html">List</a> resource provides 
        links to information about the plan and formulary, contact information, a description of the drugTiers and associated cost sharing models of the plan, and a list of FormularyDrugs. </li>    
      <li><b><a href="StructureDefinition-usdf-FormularyDrug.html">FormularyDrug</a></b>: The FormularyDrug profile of the FHIR R4 <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/medicationknowledge.html">MedicationKnowledge</a> resource provides plan-specific
      information about a prescribable drug identified by an RxNORM identifier.  Cost sharing for the drug are described by reference to a drug tier defined as part of the coverage plan.  Extensions to the MedicationKnowledge resource support
    important search use cases.
  </li>
  </ul>
  Two searchParameters have also been defined to facilitate the anticipated use cases.  See the <a href="#Anticipated-Client-Queries">Anticipated Client Queries</a> section for a description of how to query the CoveragePlan and FormularyDrug profiles
  in support of the anticipated use cases.
  <ul>
      <li><b><a href="SearchParameter-DrugPlan.html">DrugPlan</a></b>:  Makes the DrugPlan identifier of each FormularyDrug accessible for query   </li>
      <li><b><a href="SearchParameter-DrugTier.html">DrugTier</a></b>: Makes the DrugTier identifier of each FormularyDrug accessible for query    </li>
    </ul>
  

  <h2 id="formulary-structure">Formulary Structure</h2>
  <p>Formularies in the United States are normally published by health insurers on an annual basis, with minor updates during the year. 
  <p>Insurers regularly administer multiple health plans and each of those plans may have its own formulary.</p>
  <p>Each formulary contains a list of drugs.
  Drugs are placed into <strong>tiers</strong> that largely determine the cost to the consumer/patient. 
  The number and purpose of drug tiers varies across payers.  
  Each tier has an associated cost-sharing model that includes deductibles and/or coinsurance components for drugs in the tier
  when purchased through various pharmacy types.</p>
  <p>In addition to the drug tier, drugs may also list requirements on the patient (e.g., or gender) or limitations on 
      prescription (e.g., prior authorization). </p>
  <p>
  This Implementation Guide closely follows the formulary information model of the 
  <a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/QHP-provider-formulary-APIs">formularies for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) on the federal health insurance marketplace for healthcare.gov</a>.
  Publishing formularies in the QHP format should be familiar to many payers.  Drugs are specified by RxNorm codes of prescribable drugs, as 
  constrained by the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core-R4/ValueSet-us-core-medication-codes.html">US Core Medication Codes value set</a>.
  The QHP data model mandates specific value sets for some data types (e.g., types of copayments), but leaves value sets for other 
  data types at the discretion of the payer (e.g., drug tier identifiers, pharmacy types). and does not include data that is fairly standard across formularies (drug classifications, alternative drugs).
 The only areas where this Implementation Guide extends beyond the QHP formulary information model is the addition of DrugClass and DrugAlternatives to FormularyDrug.
  </p>
  The following object model shows the relationships between the resources in the current IG.
  
    <img src="formularyQHP.jpg" />
  
  A FormularyDrug is represents the availability of a drug with a specific RxNorm code within the tier structure and prescribing constraints of a specific coverageplan.   
  If a FHIR endpoint provides data on multiple CoveragePlans, querying for FormularyDrugs by their RxNorm could would return multiple entries.   Each of these FormularyDrugs
  could associate the drug to a distinct tier in the associated plan, with plan-specific prescribing constraints.   
  The CoveragePlan identifier field and the FormularyDrug planID extension field associate a FormularyDrug with a CoveragePlan.
  
  <h2 id="expected-users">Expected Users</h2>
  <p>
  This Implementation Guide is intended for insurers within the United States. 
  Currently, many insurers make their formularies available to patients using PDFs or drug search forms on their websites. 
  Providing formularies using FHIR may allow patients to more easily comparison-shop between plans and could help insurers educate 
  consumers about the differences between various drug tiers/classes.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>
<h3>Med Copays under Health Plan</h3>
<p>
This use case allows a patient to determine the out-of-pocket cost of each of their medications under their current health plan.  
The mobile application queries the electronic health record system to retrieve the list of medications for the patient (note that this is outside of the scope of this Implementation Guide)  
The mobile application queries the formulary service for cost information about the drugs that the patient takes and provides 
the out-of-pocket cost for each medication under the patient's current health plan
</p>
<h3>Shopping for Health Plans</h3>
<p>
This use case allows a patient to compare several different health plans and determine which plan has the lowest out-of-pocket cost, 
personalized to the patient's set of medications.  The mobile application queries the electronic health record system to 
retrieve the list of medications for the patient (note that this is outside of the scope of this Implementation Guide) and gets a list of payers and their FHIR endpoints from a payer endpoint directory service.  
For each payer, the mobile application queries the payer's formulary service to retrieve the list of health plans provided by that payer and the 
medication costs for each plan, specific to the patient's set of medications.  Finally, the mobile application displays a 
comparison for the out-of-pocket costs for each prospective health plan, personalized for particular medication needs of the patient.

<h1 id="open-issues">Additional Background and Open Issues</h1>
  
  <h2 id="presenting-alternative-medications">Presenting Drug Alternatives</h2>
  <p>There may be brand or generic alternatives to a particular drug in the formulary.  The QHP formulary information model, does not include drug alternatives. 
  The current Implementation Guide provides for each FormularyDrug to include an array of references to other FormularyDrugs within the same CoveragePlan.
  There may be better ways to represent equivalence classes among FormularyDrugs using the DrugClass.
   </p>
  <h2 id="representing-drug-tiers">Representing Drug Tiers</h2>
  <p>
  Drug tiers are not standardized.   The current Implementation Guide provides a defined, but extensible value set for tier identifiers based on the example list in the QHP formulary
  specification.   A move towards standardization might make this data more useful for clients of the interface.
  </p>
  <h2 id="representing-drug-classifications">Representing Drug Classifications</h2>
  <p>
 Within a consumer-facing drug formulary the primary use of drug classification is enable hierarchical browsing of the formulary contents from a
 therapeutic disease area (e.g., hypertension) or pharmacologic action (e.g., beta blocker) perspective.  An empirical review of web/PDF-based drug formularies found
 variety of different hierarchies being used to present the formulary to consumers. The current IG suggests the utility of using the MedicationKnowledge medicineClassification field
 to provide drug classification information, but does not specify a particular vocabulary.   This might be a fruitful area for subsequent standardization.
  </p>
  <h2 id="representing-pharmacy-types">Representing Pharmacy Types</h2>
  <p>
  Pharmacy types are not standardized.   The current Implementation Guide provides a defined value set for tier identifiers based on the example list in the QHP formulary
  specification which mixes channels (retail and mail order) with quantity prescribed (1 month, 3 month, etc).   
  A move towards standardization might make this data more useful for clients of the interface.
    </p>
  <h2 id="provision-of-formulary-ids">Provision of Formulary IDs and Availability of Directory</h2>
  <p>There is no single, authoritative indentifier that can be associated with a formulary (e.g., like NPI numbers identify providers in the United States). 
    How can unique formulary IDs be provisioned such that they can be implemented consistently by all payers and referenced by other entities (e.g., health plans)?
    The NCPDP Formulary and Benefits eRx implementation guide requires an identifier for each formulary.  Perhaps that can be leveraged.   Similarly, how can a client application find the 
    endpoint for a particular formulary? Is a directory of formularies needed?</p>
